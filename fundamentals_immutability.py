#fundamental vs mutability
#remember that fudamentsl values are immutable
#actually mutabiity means that can be changed or have a nature of ability of changing
#example
name="harikrishna"
#now it cannot be changed like making 
name="gaurididi"


#what if trying to change the variable value forcely
#in such case new object forms and new adddress is given to the variable
#now why is string immutable ??
#what is this happens
name_1="hari"
name_2="hari"
#and in such way 10 other boys have name hari in a institution now all variables wil be refering the same object
#and if i wanna change name_2 to ram then name_1 will also be ram than that makes conflicts so fundaments datas are
#immutable
#same thing happents in int,float,bool,complex etc
