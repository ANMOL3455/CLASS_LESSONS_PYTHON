#function can be defined by :
def function_name(argyment1,argument2):
    print("statement 1")
    print("statement 2")
    
#def is compulsary
#function_name can be empty as functions can also be anonymous
#arguments are also optional
#statements are also optional because  functions can be desined first and designed later
#example
def function():
    pass

# example:
#to calculate the sum of two numbers
def add(number1,number2):
    print(number1+number2)
    
add(23,45)
#here 23 is the number 1 passed form the point where function is called.
#here 45 is the number 2 passed form the point where function is called.
